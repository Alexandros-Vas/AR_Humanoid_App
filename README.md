# AR_Humanoid_App
AR Humanoid Dataset Generator
This repository hosts the Android application package (APK) for an AR application designed to explore and capture 3D humanoid models in various angles and distances.

## App Overview:

- Purpose: 
Visualize and capture 3D humanoid models for generating diverse datasets applicable to various fields.
- Features:
Pre-defined humanoid models: Diverse appearances and postures for versatile data creation.
- 3D Visualization: 
Interact with and explore models in augmented reality.
- Image Capture: Capture images of models at various angles and distances from a user-defined path.
- AR Video Recording: Record AR video for later data extraction, enabling analysis without being physically present in the environment.
- Offline Use: Capture the physical space beforehand for offline use, expanding data collection flexibility.
- Benefits:
  - Efficient data collection: Seamless model transitions and diverse scene customization enable efficient data collection.
  - Versatility: Applicable to various fields requiring data on 3D object interaction, movement, and appearance under different conditions.
  
Note: Users cannot introduce their own models due to limitations in the chosen framework.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset for Human Detection & Recognition  

ðŸš¨ **Note:** The dataset is **not included in this repository**. It is available for download in the **[Releases](https://github.com/Alexandros-Vas/AR_Humanoid_App/releases)** section.  

### ðŸ“œ Dataset Contents  
The dataset consists of:  
- Multiple **room folders** (e.g., `Bedroom/`, `Kitchen/`, `Office_A/`, etc.)  
- Each folder contains:  
  - **Images:** Captured under different lighting conditions, distances, and rotations.  
  - **CSV Metadata File:** Includes structured annotations such as:  
    - `Humanoid ID`  
    - `Distance from Camera`  
    - `Rotation Angle`  
    - `Bounding Box Coordinates (Body & Head)`  
    - `Screenshot Filename`  

### ðŸ“¥ Download the Dataset  
The dataset is available as a **ZIP file** in the **[Releases](https://github.com/Alexandros-Vas/AR_Humanoid_App/releases)** section.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Usage  
This dataset is designed for training and evaluating models in:  
- **Human body detection**  
- **Head detection**  
- **Face recognition**  

The metadata file provides structured information for supervised learning tasks.
